# Numpy Functions

## Arrays
array.py

There are 6 general mechanisms for creating arrays:
Conversion from other Python structures (i.e. lists and tuples)
Intrinsic NumPy array creation functions (e.g. arange, ones, zeros, etc.)
Replicating, joining, or mutating existing arrays
Reading arrays from disk, either from standard or custom formats
Creating arrays from raw bytes through the use of strings or buffers
